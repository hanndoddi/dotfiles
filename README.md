# Begining of my dotfiles rabbit hole 🕳️🐇

> Where the goal is perfection but I'm usually just happy that it sort of works

## OS

[Rofi](.config/rofi) - I figured after a while I would mainly press super key type the app and that was it I switched to Rofi because it opens fast in the middle and then it's gone.

**70% happy status**

- [ ] Shutdown option
- [ ] Calculator(do I even need it?)

## Shell

[Bash](.bashrc) - Don't use it any more but the config is here

**60% happy status**

[Zhell](.zshrc) - After trying to configure bash with some fancy features I figured it was easier to configure Zshell

**80% happy status**

- [ ] Doesn't load fast but not slow but every one is looking for that lightning speed right?

## Terminal

[Kitty](.config/kitty) - Picked it because it's called kitty, and has a cat logo. 🐈️

**90% happy status**

- [ ] Start up a bit slow but might be the laptop but I can wait 1 second.

[Starship](.config/starship.toml) - Don't know about you but I'm the type that needs a nice looking prompt.

**100% happy status**

[Yazi](.config/yazi) - Nice file browser that works in Nvim and terminal

**90% happy status**

- [ ] Would like to scale it up a bit

[Nvim](.config/nvim) - 90% of my overall config time went into Neovim... but hey, I use Neovim b.t.w.

**70% happy status (reaching 100% is probably imposable right?)**

- [ ] Loads a bit slow I mean I have like way too many plugins
- [ ] Nvim UI seems to start up slow, believe it or not it's not because of the plugins.

## More tools I use

Have not seen a reason to configure these yet.

- Lazygit 100% happy status
- FzF 100% happy status
- Glow 80% happy status
- Batcat 100% happy status
- Oneko 100% happy status winner

> My dotfiles aren't perfect. They're still evolving, and someday they'll grow old and die, just like me, no worries my health is fine.
